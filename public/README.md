# Cal Sans Font Installation

To complete the font installation:

1. Download Cal Sans font from the official source: https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/tree/main/apps/web/public/fonts/CalSans

2. Place the following files in the `/public/fonts/cal-sans/` directory:
   - CalSans-SemiBold.woff2
   - CalSans-SemiBold.woff

3. After adding these files, restart your development server.

These files are required for the proper functioning of the application. The font will not display correctly without them.

Note: If you continue to experience issues with the font, check browser developer tools for any font loading errors.
